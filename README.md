# 🚀 100 Days of Projects Challenge  

Welcome to my **100 Days of Projects** journey! 🌟  

For the next 100 days, I’ll be coding **every single day** — building projects, solving problems, and sharpening my skills step by step.  

This repository will serve as my:  
- 📒 **Learning Log** – documenting my progress.  
- 🛠 **Project Hub** – showcasing everything I build.  
- ✅ **Accountability Tracker** – keeping me consistent.  

✨ **The Goal:** Turn consistency into progress, and progress into mastery.
