# ðŸš€ 100 Days of Projects Challenge  

Welcome to my **100 Days of Projects** journey! ðŸŒŸ  

Over the next 100 days, Iâ€™ll be coding every single day â€” building projects, solving problems, and sharpening my skills step by step.  
This repository will serve as my **learning log**, **project hub**, and **accountability tracker** as I stay consistent and grow as a developer.  

âœ¨ The goal: Turn consistency into progress, and progress into mastery.  

Day 1: Tic Tac Toe
Day 2: Scientific Calculator with a Function Graph Plotter 
Day 3: Enhanced Wordle Game
